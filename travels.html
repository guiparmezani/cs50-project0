              <h3>Travels</h3>
              <p>In the last 5 years, I visited around 13 different countries and many cities. Traveling was something I always had passion for, but wasn't sure I'd be able to do much growing up. When secured a full-remote job position, I knew it was my chance to travel around the world.</p>
              <p>Being to so many different places helped me to see the world in a wider perspective, and made me grow wiser and humbler. People live in different ways, have different beliefs, and are oftetimes subjected to cultures and traditions that are particular to an area or nation where they grew up in. Besides that, some places I've been changed me for their beaut and particular features.</p>
              <p>Here are a few cities I visited before, along with a few words about them, ordered by year:</p>

              <table>
                <tr>
                  <td>1990</td>
                  <td>Joinville, Brazil</td>
                  <td>Joinville is my motherland. Although it is not the city I was born in, I moved to Joinville when I was 3 months old. My parents and one of my sisters live there. It's a humid and warm city, yet not as hot as the average country temperature. We do have all the seasons, which is something I like a lot.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2010</td>
                  <td>Washington, DC</td>
                  <td>DC was the place I saw snow for the first time in my life. I was 20 years old and I was blown away. Growing up in a tropical country, it is normal to us to be used to see the sea, but most of Brazilians have never, and will never see snow. So that's why it was a big deal for me. Washington will always be important to me.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2011</td>
                  <td>Buenos Aires, Argentina</td>
                  <td>Buenos Aires is quaint and very European ish. I did not know we had such a charming city in South America, and so near my motherland. When I visited that city, I was with my dad, my cousin and my godfather. It was a fun trip and I have good memories of it.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2015</td>
                  <td>Austin, TX</td>
                  <td>Howdy! My life's biggest dream came true when I moved to Austin. I've always wanted to live an ordinary life in the United States, and feel like I was in those movies I grew up watching. Austin was exactly that. I had a job, a salary, paid rent, had a car, and american friends. Whenever I'm in America, I try to go to Austin and see places I've been so I can live some memories again.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2018</td>
                  <td>Amsterdam, Netherlands</td>
                  <td>Out of the cities I've been, this is my favorite . There's something about how the city's features play different parts, forming a city vibe that's unique and charming. Amsterdam has personality, and it's beautiful. It's also clean, safe and uprising. The days I spent in that city were like a dream. I love everything about it.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>2020</td>
                  <td>Chicago, Illinois</td>
                  <td>One of my favorites, if not my favorite city in the United States. It's a big city, with big city vibes and skyscrapers, but not as loud and dirty as some other big cities. The lake shore drive and the lake itself are something to see. The winter is harsh, but again, I'm from Brazil, so the whole freezing/snowy kind of weather is actually amazing to me, and I cannot get enough of it. God bless Chicago.</td>
